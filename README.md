# Project Description

The Naïve-Bayes algorithm is known for its simplicity and efficiency in probabilistic classification. It uses the Bayes' rule to compute a target class's conditional probability of occurrence, given a set of input features. It is based on the naive assumption that classes of all features are mutually independent.

In this project, we'll implement the Naïve-Bayes classifier from scratch in Python, without using any external libraries. We will load the "US Census Dataset" and preprocess it. We’ll use the Scikit-learn library to evaluate the classifier. By implementing this classifier from scratch, we will gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings.
